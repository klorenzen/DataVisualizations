## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
x=3
x<-x+7
print("x=",x)
```

What is the difference between that and this code chunks?
```{r echo=FALSE}
x=3
x<-x+7
print("x=",x)
```

## Task 1

Change the following list of words to have a visual representation of their meaning.

* bold
* italic
* code
* x+y=n (math)


## Task 2

Insert a table that has the days of the week and the number of classes you have that day.

## Task 3

Insert an image of a goofy animal with a caption about why it is goofy.

## Task 4

Take your r-script from Friday (or use Dr. L's posted on blackboard) and put the pieces into multiple code chunks to build the final graphic. Not every thing from the script will make it into your code chunks, just the **interesting** parts!

Use your words between the chunks to describe what is going on.

## Task 5 

Knit your markdown and submit your HTML to blackboard.
